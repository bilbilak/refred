## üìñ About Refred

**_Refred_** is a web service designed to streamline navigating relative paths based on the referrer URL. It was created to overcome the limitation of using relative links in _GitHub_ markdowns by dynamically redirecting users to a specified path within the same domain. This is particularly useful for repositories using default health files, where absolute links are impractical, making it easier to manage consistent links across different repositories.
